Basics
------

.. code:: python

    from gurunudi import AI

    ai=AI('your_gurunudi_api_key')

AI is the class that abstracts API calls to Gurunudi AI Platform. Create an AI object as shown above. The only argument to be passed to the constructor is your Gurunudi API Key.

.. code:: python

    response=ai.chat("father of Albert Einstein")
    #now response = {"text": "Hermann Einstein is the father of Albert Einstein."}

Automatic Language Detection
----------------------------

Automatic language detection means you do not have to change anything in your code, even if the language is not English.
In the below example, we pass "como estas" (meaning "how are you" in Spanish language) as input text. Gurunudi automatically replies in Spanish saying Estoy bien (meaning "I am fine" in Spanish).

    response=ai.chat("como estas")
    #now response = {"text": "Estoy bien"}    

Custom Model Training
---------------------

You can also train your own custom model on top of Gurunudi. This can be useful if you want to deploy your own chatbot to answer queries from your customers about your products or services.
Since the model will be trained on top of Gurunudi, your customers will also be able to ask for generic information.
